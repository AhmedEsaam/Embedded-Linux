# C++ Task 5

## Q1: Time Class

It is required to create a **Time** class with member variables (hours, minutes, and seconds). The class allows displaying the object and adding two Time objects.

The Application adds two Time objects, storing the result in a third object, then displays this resulted Time.

### Example

When adding the two times (`5:45:30`) and (`11:20:50`) The resulted time will be calculated as follows:

| | hours | minutes | seconds |
| :----- | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| | `+1` | `+1` | |
| | 05 | 45 | 30 |
| | 11 | 20 | 50 |
| Result | 17 | 06 | 20 |

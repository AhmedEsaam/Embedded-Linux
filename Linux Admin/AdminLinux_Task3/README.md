## Section 1

Write a Bash script that checks IF the .bashrc file exists in the user's home
directory. If it does, append new environment variables to the file: one called
HELLO with the value of HOSTNAME, and another local variable called LOCAL
with the value of the whoami command. Additionally, the script should include a
command to open another terminal at the end. Describe what happens when the
terminal is opened.
